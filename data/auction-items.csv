The Marsh is a community arts center in San Francisco's Mission District and in Berkeley that hosts live performances and is known for developing new performance works. The name, The Marsh, a breeding ground for new performance, came out of several months Stephanie Weisman (Artistic Director) spent living on the edge of a marsh. While writing, she watched the rich interplay between the different elements that created the landscape. The Marsh seemed like a perfect metaphor for artistic development in the urban environment. Going 30 years strong, The Marsh continues to be a Bay Area rooted theater for self expression, captivating storytelling, and entertainment.

Enjoy this performance from Orchestra seats (Row P, Seats 16 & 18) at the beautiful Davies Symphony Hall. Two orchestral innovators tackle the complexities of the human condition: Richard Strauss’s passionate and provocative symphonic poems plumb the psychological depths of his literary sources. Maurice Ravel wrote his dark and intense Piano Concerto for the Left Hand because the Austrian pianist who commissioned it lost his right arm in World War I. The warped and tender waltzes of La Valse are the Frenchman's response to the dream of Viennese refinement in a murderous age.
